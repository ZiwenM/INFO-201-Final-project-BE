What is the average annual income for individuals with different levels of education, such as high school diplomas, 
bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree?

          rates and income levels over the last few decades?
How has the change in average education levels over time impacted median household income across
          different rural and urban areas?

        3) LOCATION - education.csv
How does the distribution of education levels (less than highschool, highschool diploma only, some college (1-3yrs),
college 4+ yrs) vary across different regions (urban vs rural)?

What impact does this have on regional economic development?
